# Welcome to the StackState Self-hosted product docs!



## StackState self-hosted
StackState Self-hosted can be used to observe an extensive set of technologies that originate either in your own data centers or in the cloud. If you are focussed solely on cloud technologies, such as Kubernetes or AWS, you might consider our SaaS solution. 

Supported versions:

* [StackState v5.0 docs](https://docs.stackstate.com/)
* [StackState v4.6 docs](https://docs.stackstate.com/v/4.6/)
* [StackState v4.5 docs](https://docs.stackstate.com/v/4.5/)


## StackState SaaS
StackState SaaS can be used to observe cloud technologies, such as Kubernetes and AWS services. If you want to observe a wider set of technologies, with data sources that reside in either your own data centers or in the cloud, take a look at our hybrid StackState Self-Hosted offering.
